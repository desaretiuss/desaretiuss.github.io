title: CTE - Common Table Expressions to make queries more succinct
---

### What is a CTE ?

A common table expression, or CTE is a temporary named result set, derived from a simple query.
A CTE can later be used within the execution scope of a *SELECT*, *INSERT*, *UPDATE*, or *DELETE* statement.

An example:

```postgresql
WITH cte_name AS (SELECT name, population, area
                  FROM country)
```

They can be chained together as follows:

```postgresql
WITH cte_country_info AS (SELECT *
                          FROM country
                          WHERE population > 50000000),
     cte_second AS (SELECT name
                    FROM cte_country_info)
```

They are very nice to be used to extract away complex parts out of long queries. This helps to make such queries
more readable, clean, and maintainable.
